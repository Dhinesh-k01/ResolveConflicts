Here i'm going to name the city as none

city: Banglore

here after i'm going to create 2 more branches in that i'm going to give 2 different city names and then i'm going to make pull request and then we can able to see the conflicts which going to occur that time,
we have to solve the error based on which one is correct and then merge the request.

Note:
In this file i'm going to change the city name to banglore and then i will make pull request and then i'm going to merge the file to main branch see the changes in the main file. That time i don't get any error.
