Here i'm going to name the city as none

city: none

here after i'm going to create 2 more branches in that i'm going to give 2 different city names and then i'm going to make pull request and then we can able to see the conflicts which going to occur that time,
we have to solve the error based on which one is correct and then merge the request.
